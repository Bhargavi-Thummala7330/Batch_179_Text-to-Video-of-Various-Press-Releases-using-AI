Project Overview:

This project aims to automatically convert PIB (Press Information Bureau) press releases into engaging videos using Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
The system supports English and 13 regional Indian languages, ensuring accessibility, cultural relevance, and effective communication of government information.

Features:
	•	Automatic text summarization of PIB releases using NLP.
	•	Multilingual support (English + 13 regional languages).
	•	Text-to-Speech (TTS) conversion for narration.
	•	GAN-based video generation with synchronized narration.
	•	Scalable and cost-effective solution using cloud + open-source tools.

⸻
Objectives:
	•	Convert PIB press releases into video format.
	•	Improve accessibility for audiences preferring video over text.
	•	Deliver information in regional languages.
	•	Enhance public awareness with engaging multimedia.

⸻

Literature Survey:
	•	Explored GANs for video generation from text.
	•	Learned NLP techniques for text understanding.
	•	Implemented text-to-speech (TTS) and speech recognition.
	•	Researched multilingual translation systems.
	•	Found limited studies on regional languages + PIB automation.

Methodology:

Proposed Workflow
	1.	Collect PIB press release text.
	2.	Perform text understanding & summarization using NLP.
	3.	Translate into 13 regional languages.
	4.	Generate speech narration via TTS.
	5.	Use GANs for video generation with narration.
	6.	Deliver the final video output.
